;;; qq-attachment.el --- QQ prepared attachments -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: 0WD0 <wd.1105848296@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Projection and upload-ahead helpers for Gateway Prepared Attachments.
;; Staged resources remain account-neutral; attachments bind
;; those immutable bytes to one stable account slot, one conversation, and one
;; media use.  Native MsgInfo, upload keys, Highway tickets, and local paths
;; never enter this projection.
