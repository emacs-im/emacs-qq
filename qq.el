;;; qq.el --- Native QQ chat client -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: 0WD0 <wd.1105848296@gmail.com>
;; Keywords: comm
;; Version: 2.0.0
;; URL: https://github.com/0WD0/emacs-qq
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (websocket "1.16") (transient "0.7") (appkit "0.2.0"))

;;; Commentary:

;; emacs-qq provides a native QQ client inside Emacs.
;;
;; Version 2 deliberately speaks one native protocol:
;; - connect to the long-lived native service over WebSocket
;; - select and control complete lifecycles for multiple QQ accounts
;; - browse recent sessions in an appkit-backed root buffer
;; - open chat buffers, fetch history, and exchange structured messages
;; - keep stable managed-account state updated from closed protocol events
;; - transient menus for root / chat / message / attachments
