;;; qq-runtime.el --- Appkit session ownership for emacs-qq -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: 0WD0 <wd.1105848296@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Own one Gateway application plus one account-scoped Appkit application for
;; every QQ account projected by emacs-qq.  Appkit owns lifecycle and views;
;; `qq-state' owns the account-partitioned protocol state.
