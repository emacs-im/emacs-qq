;;; qq-directory.el --- QQ contact projection -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: 0WD0 <wd.1105848296@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Account-scoped adapters for the Gateway friend, group, and group-member
;; methods.  Every request, cache entry, and projection is owned by a stable
;; account ID; changing the UI's selected account never revokes another
;; account's directory work.
