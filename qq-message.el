;;; qq-message.el --- QQ service message projection -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: 0WD0 <wd.1105848296@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Domain adapter and account-partitioned projection for native service
;; message and recall events.  Every managed account is projected even while
;; another account is selected in the management UI.  The Gateway filters
;; obsolete Native Session work before publishing events; exact session
;; identity is never part of the Emacs wire or projection model.

The `message.send' protocol receipt carries the conversation `server_sequence'
(PbSendMsgResp field 11) but not the NT snowflake `message_id'.  The snowflake
arrives later, unreliably, as a self-echo `message.received' push — a push
that frequently omits ContentHead fields, never reaches the sending session,
or reaches it before its snowflake is assigned.  Relying on that push left
outgoing rows stuck on their optimistic `local-*' id for both group and
private chats.

This deterministic fallback fetches the single conversation sequence from
history (`SsoGetGroupMsg' / `SsoGetC2cMsg', both routed through
`message.get_history') right after the receipt.  The returned message carries
the snowflake as `server-id' and reuses the normal pending-rekey merge, so the
optimistic row is promoted even when the self-echo push never arrives.

The fetch is skipped when the receipt has no nonzero conversation sequence,
when Gateway is not ready, when the account is gone, or when a racing
self-echo push already consumed the pending receipt."

Message ID or, for id-less group history, the authoritative group sequence.
Gateway resolves the observed native source metadata.  At least one and at
most 128 non-reply content elements are required.  RAW-MESSAGE is an optional
optimistic rendering override.
OPTIMISTIC-SEGMENTS, when non-nil, are stored in the pending row instead of
protocol-ready SEGMENTS so local media previews never enter the wire request.
The original reply element remains part of this local rendering shape.
The currently negotiated `dataline.send_text' operation accepts one nonempty
text segment of at most 160 UTF-8 bytes.  Desktop and mobile local locators use
the same type-8 wire operation while retaining distinct sender-local timeline
identities.  That method boundary does not describe stock DataLine file,
