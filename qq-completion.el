;;; qq-completion.el --- Composer completion for emacs-qq -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; QQ-specific providers and protocol insertion built on appkit's generic chat
;; completion substrate.  Group members come from the strict fork-native
;; `emacs_search_group_members' action; faces remain structured send segments.
